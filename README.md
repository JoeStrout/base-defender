A [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro) game in which you move around the map, defending your castle from the invading hordes!

I'm developing this game as a "live coding" exercise, which means that all my work on it is recorded and then posted to YouTube, with little to no editing.  You'll see me make mistakes, wrestle with bugs, and occasionally get stuck.  But you'll also get to see how I work through those challenges, and build a complete game from the ground up.
